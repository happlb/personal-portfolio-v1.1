                    I am a recent graduate of the Milwaukee School of Engineering with a major in
                    computer engineering and a minor in mathematics. I took my first User Experience (UX) class my last quarter
                    at MSOE and enjoyed the course work immensely. Since graduation I have started a personal project of
                    designing a personal portfolio website using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript and using tools such as git
                    and Visual Studio.
